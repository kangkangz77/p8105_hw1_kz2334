## Problem 1

Create a dataframe comprised of four different vectors:
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r Problem 1.1}

df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(10,0,5),
  vec_indict = I(vec_unif > 2),
  vec_char =  letters[seq(1,10)],
  vec_factor = factor(c("up","down","up","down","up","down","up","down","up","down"))
)

```

The elements and their classes are shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df
```


Caculate mean of each variable in the dataframe:
```{r Problem 1.2, warning = FALSE}
mean_unif = mean(df$vec_unif)
mean_indict = mean(df$vec_indict)
mean_char = mean(df$vec_char)
mean_factor = mean(df$vec_factor)
```

Generate a table of each mean value:

  Variable    |    Mean
------------- | -------------
     uniform  | `r mean_unif`
indicator  | `r mean_indict`
character  | `r mean_char`
factor  | `r mean_factor`
