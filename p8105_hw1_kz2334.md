Problem 1
---------

Create a dataframe comprised of four different vectors:

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(10,0,5),
  vec_indict = I(vec_unif > 2),
  vec_char =  letters[seq(1,10)],
  vec_factor = factor(c("up","down","up","down","up","down","up","down","up","down"))
)
```

The elements and their classes are shown below:

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_unif vec_indict vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <I(lgl)>   <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    3.31  TRUE       a        up        
    ##  2    2.10  TRUE       b        down      
    ##  3    2.37  TRUE       c        up        
    ##  4    3.41  TRUE       d        down      
    ##  5    0.660 FALSE      e        up        
    ##  6    2.11  TRUE       f        down      
    ##  7    0.662 FALSE      g        up        
    ##  8    3.68  TRUE       h        down      
    ##  9    4.19  TRUE       i        up        
    ## 10    1.11  FALSE      j        down

Caculate mean of each variable in the dataframe:

``` r
mean_unif = mean(df$vec_unif)
mean_indict = mean(df$vec_indict)
mean_char = mean(df$vec_char)
mean_factor = mean(df$vec_factor)
```

Generate a table of each mean value:

| Variable  | Mean      |
|-----------|-----------|
| uniform   | 2.3591255 |
| indicator | 0.7       |
| character | NA        |
| factor    | NA        |

**Answer**: Uniform sample and logical vector work, while character vector and factor charactor do not work.

-   Because uniform sample are Real number which can be calculated.

-   As for indicator variable, 1 represents TRUE and 0 represents FALSE. When indicator variable are being calculated, the numeric value is used.

-   Character variable and factor variable are both nominal variable, it is meaningless to calculate their means.
